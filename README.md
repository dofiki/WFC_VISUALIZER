# Wave Function Collapse (WFC) Implementation in Unity (Tile-Based Approach).

*A procedural tile-based map generator using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm in Unity.*

---

## Overview

This project implements a Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm for procedural map generation in Unity. It generates tile-based maps by respecting tile socket compatibility to ensure seamless connections between terrain types such as roads, grass, and crossings.

## Attribution

This project is inspired by and based on the **Wave Function Collapse (WFC)** algorithm originally created by **Maxim Gumin**.

* Original repository: [https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse)
* Original article and explanation: [https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/blob/master/README.md)

The Unity implementation and modifications in this project are my own.

## Features

* Procedural generation of maps with variable width and height.
* Tile compatibility defined via socket types for top, bottom, left, and right sides.
* Supports multiple tile types including grass, horizontal and vertical roads, connectors, and crossings.
* Ensures valid tile placement by propagating constraints during map generation.
* Prevents invalid tile connections to maintain natural map layouts.
* Expandable system easily allowing new tile prefabs and socket definitions.

---

## How It Works

* Each grid cell holds a list of possible tile prefabs (options).
* Tiles collapse one by one, starting from a random cell.
* Collapsing selects one tile randomly from possible options and removes other options.
* Constraints propagate to neighbors to filter their tile options, maintaining socket compatibility.
* The process repeats until all cells are collapsed with exactly one tile.

## Socket Definitions

Each tile prefab has socket definitions indicating which socket types it can connect to on each side.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Unity 2021.3 or later recommended.
* Basic knowledge of Unity Editor and C# scripting.

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Import your tile prefabs into the `allTilePrefabs` list in the `MapGenerator` component.
4. Configure grid size and tile size as needed.

### Usage

* Attach the `MapGenerator` script to an empty GameObject.
* Assign your tile prefabs.
* Run the scene to generate the map.
